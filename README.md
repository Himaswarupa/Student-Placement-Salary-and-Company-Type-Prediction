# Student Placement, Salary, and Company-Type Prediction System

### Overview
This system uses machine learning to predict students' placement status, expected salary, and suitable company types based on academic performance, skills, and other metrics. Our goal is to help students make informed career decisions and optimize their placement preparation.

### Problem Statement
Students often lack insight into their placement potential and suitable career paths. This leads to:
- Suboptimal preparation for placement processes
- Poor matching between students and employers
- Missed opportunities and salary negotiations below potential
- Lack of personalized guidance for career planning

### Solution
Our web application leverages machine learning to provide personalized placement insights:
1. **Placement Status Prediction**: Predicts whether a student will be placed based on their profile
2. **Salary Prediction**: Estimates expected salary for students predicted to be placed
3. **Company Type Recommendation**: Suggests suitable company categories based on predicted salary ranges

### Current Progress
